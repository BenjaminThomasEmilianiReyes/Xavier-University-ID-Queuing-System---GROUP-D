### Xavier University ID Queuing System

Currently, the ID processing and claiming procedure is handled manually
on-site. Students must physically line up, which can take hours, especially during
peak enrollment or replacement seasons.

This results in:
- Late class issue due to long queues.
- Inconsistent tracking of requests.
- Difficulty managing time slots and prioritizing schedules.
- Administrative overload due to lack of automation.

There is a clear need for a centralized, automated queuing system that simplifies
the scheduling and ID management process for both users and administrators.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
We propose the development of a web-based ID Queuing System for Xavier
University. The system will allow users to reserve time slots for ID processing online.
